# dcrwallet v1.6.2

This release focuses on bug fixes and feature improvements for VSP ticketbuying
and change mixing.

## New Features

* A `accountunlocked` JSON-RPC method was added, allowing clients to determine
  whether an account has been encrypted with a unique passphrase, and if it is
  currently unlocked if so.

* The `setvotechoices` JSON-RPC method will now use the vspd client to set vote
  choices at the VSP, if any is configured in the application settings and the
  ticket was bought for the VSP.

## Bug Fixes

* A UTXO selection issue which caused "low balance" errors during the additional
  split transaction sometimes necessary when purchasing tickets with a VSP was
  fixed.  Some UTXOs of the account were not always being considered during the
  creation of this transaction, which led to the balance errors.

* A check for a too-low fee when mixing at the smallest common amount was added.
  This previously was causing "invalid submission" errors, as the server would
  reject the submission for not paying enough fee.
