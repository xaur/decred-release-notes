# DCRDEX v0.1.2

This patch release improves handling of slow contract audits, fixes a bug on 32-bit systems, automatically unlocks wallets to avoid swap failures if the wallet unexpectedly became locked, and improves the display of canceled orders.  There are also a few usability improvements for developers.

Please read the [initial release (v0.1.0) notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/release-v0.1.0) for important information and instructions.

## Client (dexc)

### Features and Improvements

#### User-facing

- When already logged in, automatically attempt to unlock wallets as needed for trades.  This helps prevent users from breaking their swaps by accidentally locking their wallets. (https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/de409134c37270145dc7094e89d6ef9d8e2d1f74)
- Display cancel order matches differently from trade matches. (https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b01358159eeb7cbe5024f58f035306e98bb0a2f8)

#### Developer

- Create a `Ready` method so consumer packages know when the client core is done starting up.  (https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c3d9e80602e9cad8cc7ebc80e2d7e96a2257d3ab)
- Increase notification channel capacity to prevent dropped notifications when there are many simultaneous events. (https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/2de62a378d8b964c6ff2a485ca907b0b1c2b7ac4)
- Remove the obsolete (and incomplete) terminal UI.  (https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/75ff8d09f6f5f898dfd23ebbacbb7a3f1d2e473f)

### Fixes

- Workaround for 64-bit atomic variable access on 32-bit platforms. (https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3abaf434a3da3603916969f7af4b0c487b76b149)
- Prevent contract auditing from blocking incoming messages.  Continue to search for counterparty contracts until it succeeds or the match is revoked, and log a warning if the audit is taking a long time. (https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/23f2f362486141419d4a321674229f3716fd4faf)
