This contains fixes and improvements to the initial release (v0.1.0).

The primary fix included in this patch release is meant to address the possibility of a failure to properly recover from a revoked match in certain circumstances, resulting in a `"order not reported by the server on connect"` error message (e.g. from `redeemMatches` during recover on startup or reconnect) instead of automatically completing the revoked swap via refund or automatic redemption.
